# Installing

**cjdk** is a pure Python package and does not require a pre-installed JDK or
JRE.

Python 3.8 or later is required.

```sh
pip install cjdk
```

This installs the `cjdk` Python package and the `cjdk` command-line tool.

As usual, make sure you are using the right `pip` for your Python installation
(when in doubt, use `path/to/python -m pip` instead of `pip`). Use of a virtual
environment is recommended.
